#We will use the "and" operator to determine if two counties, Arapahoe and El Paso, are in the list of counties:

if "Arapahoe" in counties and "El Paso" in counties:
    print("Arapahoe and El Paso are in the list of counties.")
else:
    print("Arapahoe or El Paso is not in the list of counties.")
#check if either "Arapahoe" or "El Paso" is in the counties list. In the previous code, replace the logical operator "and" with "or" and run the file:

if "Arapahoe" in counties or "El Paso" in counties:
    print("Arapahoe or El Paso is in the list of counties.")
else:
    print("Arapahoe and El Paso are not in the list of counties.")

# using logical operator not in:
if "Arapahoe" in counties and "El Paso" not in counties:
   print("Only Arapahoe is in the list of counties.")
else:
    print("Arapahoe is in the list of counties and El Paso is not in the list of counties.")
